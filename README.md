UETIMS - University Hostel Inventory and Management System
Vision of the Product
UETIMS is a desktop application designed for Campus Coordinators to streamline the inventory management of university hostels. It aims to replace manual processes with a user-friendly, comprehensive solution for managing and tracking hostel inventory efficiently.

Project Description
The role of a Campus Coordinator in managing hostel facilities has become more complex, and there is a growing need for efficient and organized inventory management. UETIMS addresses these challenges by providing a tool that helps coordinators manage all hostel-related inventory, including:

Electrical and hardware supplies
Sanitary items
Furniture
Public, staff, and student room inventory
The system allows Campus Coordinators to:

Add, edit, view, and remove inventory items.
Manage detailed hostel records, including the number of corridors, rooms, washrooms, and storeys.
Record incoming deliveries with supplier details, dates, and items.
Log inventory requests, track their status, and manage inventory responses.
Filter and search for specific items, records, or deliveries.
Generate monthly reports on inventory consumption.
Prioritize data security and ensure accuracy in all operations.
UETIMS provides an intuitive and accessible interface, with built-in training materials and user documentation to ensure ease of use for all.

Project Goal
The primary goal of UETIMS is to enhance inventory visibility and management for university hostels, enabling Campus Coordinators to:

Know when and how much to order.
Allocate stock efficiently.
Track inventory locations.
Ensure the right products are available at the right time.
By optimizing these processes, UETIMS aims to improve the overall operational efficiency of inventory management in hostel facilities.
